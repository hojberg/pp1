# Project Page One/Kanon

This is an app for intellectual and cultural history. It takes objects of cultural significance to what we think of as "the West" (in addition to the inclusion of what I think of as the west) and relates them to one another, their authors, geographies, and artifacts/instances of those objects.

It is written in rail with a bit of help from [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
